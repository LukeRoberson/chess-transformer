# To Do

## Generation
* Put move numbers back in when generating
* Stop generating when we reach an end token
* Add temperature

# Tokenizer
* Add support for parallel processing when tokenizing strings
* Can games be tokenized in batches?

# Testing
* See if a different activation function in the FFN has an effect
* See if adding biases in the attention heads makes a difference

# Wishlist
* During finetuning, can we add annotations to explain moves?
